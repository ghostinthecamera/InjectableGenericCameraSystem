(e.g. you make money with the shots or videos you produce with this camera), consider a donation. 

There's no support. If the camera breaks because of a game update, you're encouraged to send in a pull request with a fix.

### Features
- Camera control:
	- FoV control
	- Free unlimited camera movement and rotation 
- Ansel everywhere
- No clip-check anymore in Ansel/free camera
- Makes all cvars writable

NOTE: If you enable Ansel using Alt-F2, you shouldn't enable this camera. This camera uses the function in the game
used by Ansel as well.

During cutscenes, it's not possible to move the camera or even pause the game. Also, the black bars in cutscenes
are still present.
