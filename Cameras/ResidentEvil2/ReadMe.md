### DirectX 11 only
The tools only work with DirectX11 of the game. Use the in-game setting to switch to DirectX11 if you've opted to use DirectX12
*before* you inject the tools.

### Scaling factor
* Be careful with the resolution scaling factor in the camera tools settings. Using a value of 4-5 or higher with a very 
high resolution will likely make the game become unresponsive and crash if you don't have the latest greatest videocard.
Resolution scaling already creates a high-res framebuffer, so e.g. using a factor of 2.0 on a 5K resolution effectively
means the game renders a 10K image, something it won't be able to do, most likely.
